# Proxy Design Pattern in C#

## Overview

The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides an object representing another object to control access to it. This repository provides a simple example of implementing the Proxy Design Pattern in C# with a use case of an image loader.

### What is the Proxy Design Pattern?

The Proxy Design Pattern involves creating a proxy class that acts as an intermediary for a real object. The proxy controls access to the real object, allowing you to add additional functionality like lazy loading, access control, logging, or monitoring without altering the real object's code.

## Implementation

In this example, we have implemented the Proxy Design Pattern for an image loader. It consists of the following components:

- **`IImage` Interface**: An interface defining the methods that both the real object (`RealImage`) and the proxy object (`ImageProxy`) implement.

- **`RealImage` Class**: A class representing the real object, which loads and displays an image from disk.

- **`ImageProxy` Class**: A proxy class that controls access to the real image. It loads the real image lazily, only when it's needed.

- **Sample Usage**: A usage example in the `Program.cs` file demonstrates how to use the proxy to load and display an image.

## Benefits

- **Lazy Loading**: The proxy loads the real object only when it is needed, reducing resource usage and improving performance.

- **Access Control**: You can implement access control logic in the proxy to restrict or manage access to the real object.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: The proxy can log and monitor access to the real object, helping with debugging and performance analysis.

- **Improved Responsiveness**: In scenarios where the real object creation is time-consuming, such as network requests, the proxy can make the application more responsive by loading the object in the background.

## Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Adding a proxy can add complexity to the codebase, especially in scenarios with multiple proxies.

- **Overhead**: The proxy can introduce a slight overhead due to the extra level of indirection.

- **Increased Maintenance**: When the real object's interface changes, you may need to update the proxy as well.

Happy coding!
